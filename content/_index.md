I'm doing a lot of development in Scala + Play these days.  I often come up against a problem with a "hard won" solution.  It might be a fundamental misunderstanding on my part, something I just haven't run into before, or where Googling isn't as helpful as it often is.  Regardless, the solution came at some pain to myself.  To help make that hard won solution less painful, I'm posting here to remind me and to help others. 

I hope you find it useful.
